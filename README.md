# dvdrentals-sql

## Overview
- In this project, I use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database.
- The package contains four sql scripts (.sql files) where I perform anaylysis on a movie rental store database in order to answer some business questions.

## Notes
- movies_families_are_watching.sql analyses the most watched family movies in the rental store\
